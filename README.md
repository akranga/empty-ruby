# Ruby quick start 

This is an "empty" ruby quickstart workspace. Saves some minutes on Code Retreat for ruby workstation setup.

Before you start you need to have intalled bundler. If you use Cloud9 IDE then bundler is already there.

To start run following command.
```shell
$ bundle install

# Installing rspec 3.4.0
# ...
# Bundle complete! 2 Gemfile dependencies, 11 gems now installed.
# Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
```		

To run tests just run

```shell
$ rspec spec/main_spec.rb 

# Run options: include {:focus=>true}
# All examples were filtered out; ignoring {:focus=>true}

# Randomized with seed 31692
# .

# Finished in 0.00163 seconds (files took 0.06806 seconds to load)
# 1 example, 0 failures
```
## Happy Coding!
